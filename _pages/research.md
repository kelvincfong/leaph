# Research

Our goal is to advance environmental justice and health equity through exposure assessment and epidemiologic research.

**Exposure Assessment**

We leverage satellite remote sensing to ascertain the levels of environmental exposures around individuals and in communities. Examples include air pollution, extreme temperatures, and green space. We also conduct primary measurements such as low-cost environmental monitoring.

**Population Health and Epidemiology**

We employ statistical methods to investigate the effects of environmental exposures on human health outcomes. For example, we use regression analyses to determine the risk for developing cardiovascular disease, given an air pollution exposure level. We also apply causal inference techniques to predict how health disparities may change under different environmental scenarios.
