**We are the Laboratory for Environmental Assessment and Population Health (LEAPH)**

We aim to understand how health disparities arise from environmental conditions. To do this, we specialize in 1) environmental assessment and 2) epidemiology. Ultimately, we seek to inform decision-making to improve health and well-being, and to promote environmental justice. 

For more details, see the [Research](research) page.

We are based in the [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/earth-environmental-sciences.html) at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/).

*Dalhousie University is located in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq. We are all Treaty people.*

We are grateful for funding from Research Nova Scotia ([New Health Investigator Grant](https://researchns.ca/2023/01/10/research-nova-scotia-supports-early-career-health-researchers-with-1-22-million-in-funding/)) and Dalhousie University (Vice President of Research and Innovation).
