We are a research team in the [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/earth-environmental-sciences.html) at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/).

We aim to understand how our environment affects our health and well-being. To do this, we specialize in 1) environmental assessment and 2) epidemiology.

For exposure assessment, we apply satellite remote sensing to assess consequential exposures such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and access to green space. We also  

In population health analyses, we apply epidemiologic methods to estimate the effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes. We are especially interested in quantifying environmental health disparities and investigating strategies to advance environmental justice and health equity.
