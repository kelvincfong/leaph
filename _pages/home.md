In population health analyses, we apply epidemiologic methods to estimate the effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes. We are especially interested in quantifying environmental health disparities and investigating strategies to advance environmental justice and health equity.

We are based in the [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/earth-environmental-sciences.html) at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/).

*Dalhousie University is located in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq. We are all Treaty people.*
