**We are the Laboratory for Environmental Assessment and Population Health (LEAPH)**

We aim to understand how health disparities arise from environmental conditions. To do this, we specialize in 1) environmental assessment and 2) epidemiology. Ultimately, we seek to inform decision-making to improve health and well-being, and to promote environmental justice. 

For more details, see the [Research](research) page.

We are based in the [Department of Environmental and Occupational Health](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/environmental-and-occupational-health) at [George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/). LEAPH was established in 2022 in the [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/science/earth-environmental-sciences.html) at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/).

We are grateful for funding from Research Nova Scotia [New Health Investigator Grant](https://researchns.ca/2023/01/10/research-nova-scotia-supports-early-career-health-researchers-with-1-22-million-in-funding/) and the [Canada First Research Excellence Fund](https://www.ofi.ca/programs/transform-climate-action).
